Eureca. Resolvi o problema da função SysFileOpen.   O problema da função SysFileOpen estava na forma como no windows a função SysUtils.fileOpen trabalha.      Caso ocorra um erro a função SysUtils.fileOpen retorna high(THandle).   Para corrigir precisei modificar a função SysSetResult.         2021-11-12 16:56 - Documentar a unit mi.rtl.files e criar a função CopyFile().   2021-11-12 18:05 - Criar a função SysFileSetSize para truncar o arquivo e documenta-la.   2021-11-13      Criado a class TFiles herdade de TConsts com propósito em encapsular as funções de acesso ao sistema operacional.

Após criar o arquivo o mesmo deve ser fechado e aberto novamente com o mapa de bits mode e shareMode passado no parâmetro.         Criar método TFiles.FileSeek()   Criar método TFiles.FileRead()      2021-11-16      O método SysFileSeek não gerar erro se o ponteiro do arquivo for inválido.      Para contornar devo fazer a crítica se o ponteiro é maior que zero e menor que fileSize.   Essa solução não atende porque não fileSeek não tem o nome do arquivo.   Entendendo porque SysUtils.FileSeek não dar erro quando se tenta posicionar além do fim do arquivo:      https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html   No linux lseek() permite que o deslocamento do arquivo seja definido além do final do arquivo (mas isso não altera o tamanho do arquivo).

A classe TPath foi projetada para representar o caminho dos nós, distinguindo entre arquivos e diretórios.

PARÂMETROS:      Root: TMi_rtl_treenode      O nó raiz ao qual o novo nó filho será adicionado. Este parâmetro representa o ponto de partida na árvore onde o novo nó será inserido.      FileName: string      O nome do arquivo que será utilizado para criar o novo nó. O FileName pode ser um caminho completo ou parcial, e os nós serão criados de acordo com as partes do caminho.         RETORNO:      TMi_rtl_treenode      Retorna o novo nó filho criado e adicionado à árvore. Este nó corresponde ao nome do arquivo especificado.

Essa instância pode ser utilizada como Data em um nó da árvore (TMi_rtl_treenode).   O método retorna o objeto TPathAction recém-criado, que pode ser associado ao Data de um nó da árvore.         FUNCIONAMENTO:      O método compara o nome do arquivo extraído de aFileName com aPart.      Se forem iguais (ignorando maiúsculas e minúsculas), isso indica que aPart é o nome do arquivo, e o objeto criado será marcado como uma folha (IsSheet := true).

Exemplos:      GET: É idempotente porque solicitar o mesmo recurso várias vezes não altera o estado do servidor. Você sempre recebe a mesma resposta (assumindo que o recurso não mudou entre as requisições).   PUT: É idempotente porque ao submeter uma mesma requisição PUT várias vezes com os mesmos dados, resultará no mesmo estado do recurso no servidor, independentemente de quantas vezes a operação for repetida.   DELETE: É idempotente porque a exclusão de um recurso já inexistente não terá efeito adicional; após a primeira exclusão, requisições subsequentes de DELETE não terão nenhum impacto.            Ações não idempotentes:      POST: Não é idempotente, pois cada requisição pode criar um novo recurso ou alterar o estado do servidor de maneira diferente.

É idempotente, o que significa que várias requisições PUT com os mesmos dados não devem alterar o estado do recurso além da primeira requisição.  HttpDELETE  Remove um recurso identificado pela URL. Como PUT, é idempotente.  HttpPATCH  Aplica modificações parciais a um recurso. Diferente do PUT, que substitui o recurso completo, o PATCH altera apenas os campos fornecidos.  HttpHEAD  Solicita as mesmas informações que o GET, mas sem o corpo da resposta. É utilizado para obter metadados, como cabeçalhos HTTP.  HttpOPTIONS  Retorna os métodos HTTP suportados por um recurso. Útil para verificar quais operações são permitidas em um endpoint.  HttpTRACE  Realiza um loopback de uma mensagem de solicitação para fins de teste e diagnóstico, retornando a requisição ao cliente.

Se não estamos no editor de propriedade então não temos controle do código no modo design. Qual o meu problema: O formulário deve ser criado em tempo de execução, porém eu queria ver como ele estava ficando sem precisar compilar e executar o código, por isso coloquei o código em um stringList e ao ativar o objeto, o formulário é criado. Porém esses objetos criados no designer não podem ficar no arquivo de recursos porque quando for executado vai haver duplicidade.      Quando eu desativo o objetos todos os objetos que ele criou são excluídos do arquivo de recursos.   Isso eu já faço agora, mais quando distribuir o componente as pessoas vão deixar esses componente usado no teste e ao executar vai haver error.   Por isso eu queria que caso a propriedade active tivesse em true eu queria que ela ficasse em false.

O programa de linha de comando stork, receberá o arquivo de configuração .index_stork.toml e criará o arquivo de índice list_stork.st para ser uado como índice do programa stornk.js. O arquivo é blob serializado e compactado que a biblioteca Stork Javascript utiliza. Geralmente tem a extensão de arquivo de nome .st e tem aproximadamente o tamanho de um JPEG.   Para criar um índice de pesquisa, o projeto Stork requer que se crie um arquivo de configuração que declare quais documentos devem ser indexados. Este arquivo de configuração deve ter o formato de arquivo TOML.      EXEMPLO:      [input]    base_directory = &quot;&quot;    url_prefix = &quot;&quot;    files = [   ]           NOTAS      Este unit espera o arquivo que o arquivo './templates/stork/index_stork.toml' existe e tenha a tag files_path      HISTÓRICO      Criado por: Paulo Pacheco paulosspacheco@yahoo.com.br)   2023-09-12      14:00 as 17:00      Criar unit      u_criate_index_stork     Criar unit u_criate_index_stork; ✅   Craar classe TIndex_stork;   Criar function CrateIndexStork:Integer;      2023-09-14      08:32 as 11:50      Criar métodos      Create;   Destroy;   toml_Undefined;   CrateIndexStork -      Documentar unit      u_criate_index_stork     Documentar unit u_criate_index_stork; -            ", "tags": "", "url": "u_criate_index_stork.html"},
